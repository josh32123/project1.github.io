                    <p>The analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging station data has become increasingly vital due to rising electricity demand, reduced reliance on crude oil, and lower carbon emissions. This study collected EV charging station data from 2011 to 2020, focusing on transaction fees, charging levels, and methods of ending charging sessions. Furthermore, it utilized data visualization techniques to depict charging time, energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, and gasoline savings annually. A decrease in energy consumption is noted in 2020 due to covid-19. Additionally, the SKTime algorithm is employed to forecast these attributes from 2021 to 2026, revealing significant growth in the average charging time, energy consumption, GHG emission reductions and gasoline savings. Also the forecast shows the total energy consumption by all charging stations.<br />
